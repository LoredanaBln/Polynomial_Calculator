--more test cases
--unit test for toString ----> make it prettyPrint
--sort in the JTextField to compare initial string with the polynomial obtained after the conversion in the StringConversion class
        --possible issues -it uses the same function, even if the input is bad it will pass the test?
        --maybe use a LinkedHashMap and compare the string afterwards, also keep the TreeMap
